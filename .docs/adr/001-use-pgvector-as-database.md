# ADR 001: Use PgVector as Database

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-06-10

## Context

The application requires efficient semantic search and similarity operations on high-dimensional vectors, particularly for features related to artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and natural language processing. Traditional relational databases do not natively support efficient vector operations at scale.

## Decision

We have decided to use PgVector, a PostgreSQL extension that enables efficient storage and querying of vector data. PgVector provides operators and functions for similarity search, making it suitable for integrating with machine learning models and recommendation systems.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Enables efficient and scalable vector similarity search.
  - Seamlessly integrates with the PostgreSQL ecosystem, leveraging its robustness and advanced features.
  - Facilitates the implementation of AI-driven and semantic retrieval features.
- **Cons:**
  - Requires managing the PgVector extension in deployment environments.
  - Adds some complexity to the database infrastructure.

## Alternatives Considered

- Using a specialized NoSQL vector database (e.g., Milvus, Pinecone).
- Implementing vector search in-memory or with flat files.
